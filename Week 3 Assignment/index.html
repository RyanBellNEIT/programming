                While I was born in Boston, I grew up in    the city of Lynn,   
                Massachusetts. Ever since I was a little kid I always had a huge passion for video games, considering my parents let me play R rated games even when I was a little kid. Video games grew up on me and before I knew it, most of my days were spent playing.</p>
