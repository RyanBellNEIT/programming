    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <img src="images/NEIT.png" alt="NEIT Logo">
    <p>My name is Ryan Bell and I am from <b>Boston, Massachusetts.</b> While I was born in Boston, I grew up in the city of Lynn,
        Massachusetts. Ever since I was a little kid I always had a huge passion for video games, considering my parents let me play
        R rated games even when I was a little kid. Video games grew up on me and before I knew it, most of my days were spent playing.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've always wanted in career in video games. Since growing up 15+ years playing and watching video games, it's basically my dream
        to play or make video games for a living. That's when I found NEIT, a great looking college. Besides, video games, I love to
        spend time with friends, and do some other stuff too. I love doing physical activity stuff, especially when it's a trampoline park.
        I also love spending my time making Youtube videos, and have a lot of experience video editing, considering I've been video editing
        for 4+ years now.</p>
